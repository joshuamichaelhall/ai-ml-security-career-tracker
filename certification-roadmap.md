# AI/ML Security Certification Roadmap
## Strategic Path to Credentialed Expertise

### Certification Philosophy
Certifications in AI/ML Security serve to:
1. **Validate foundational knowledge** (especially for career changers)
2. **Pass HR/ATS filters** for initial job search
3. **Structure learning path** with clear milestones
4. **Build credibility** in a new field

**After Year 2**: Focus shifts from certifications to creation, research, and thought leadership
